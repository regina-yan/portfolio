                    SuperBill's first product was SuperPay, a platform where patients receive free out-of-network claim filing when they pay their provider through SuperPay.

            <h4>Product Summary</h4>
            <p class="">As a patient, you visit your out-of-network healthcare provider and SuperPay will handle the payment side. As a result, everyone benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Perks for the patient:</b> they don’t have to deal with the confusing, complicated process of filing claims to get their reimbursement money - a check will show up like magic!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Perks for the provider:</b> they don’t have to worry about sending “superbills” to their patients, and they get paid upfront for their services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Perks for us:</b> we get a tiny % of the money from interchange (we pay the provider immediately through a virtual credit card, and then collect money from the patient) without having to charge the provider OR the patient a fee. Truly a win-win-win
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p class="">I was the <b>sole designer</b> for this product. We reached a point of over 1,000 providers and patients and $250k in transactions, but ultimately pivoted due to struggles with patient sign ups. Learned a lot, cried a little, gained experience to be a better designer and partner in the next project.</p>

            <h4>I'm Proud of...</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Providers and patients truly loving the work we did. </b> We delivered what we promised, and our users were happy. What more could you ask for as a product designer? (whispers, *profitability and better clickthrough rate*)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Reducing our support team’s product-related tickets to 0.</b> I maintained a close relationship with our customer success / support team, and anytime they received product related complaints (“help, my log-in credentials aren’t working and I’m positive I’m typing it in correctly”), I made swift analyses and changes (“oh, it’s probably because the provider is trying to sign in on the patient portal. Since we can’t combine them due to dev reasons, let’s make it more obvious which site you’re on, and suggest a link to the other portal if you hit the log-in error message).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Advocating for good UX.</b> As the only designer and the one responsible for our users’ experiences, I am proud of how I researched and came up with my own ideas for features, spoke up when I disagreed with our founders, and put the users first (though sometimes I think if we were more aggressive about company strategies and less "pure good for our users", we could have been more successful business-wise).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="padding-page-divider"></div>
        <div class="">
            <h4>But this failed, right?</h4>
            <p>Ultimately, SuperPay didn’t work out because we were never able to get enough patients to fully onboard, but hey I learned a lot and this project led us to where we are today.</p>
            <p>
                We actually found our next (currently-still-alive) project in the middle of all this. While filing out-of-network claims for patients in SuperPay, we found that <b>each benefits verification call we made took over 30 minutes (working through the insurance company’s automated system, waiting on hold, etc.), and we desperately needed to streamline this process to remain profitable.</b> With recent developments in AI, we built our own “robodialer” who would call insurance companies and output the benefits information to us. This worked quite marvelously, and we found that practices, billers and RCM companies all needed the same thing, just different scenarios. Thus began the SuperDial journey.
