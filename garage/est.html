                    <p>In August 2023, Shep and I biked the Empire State Trail for a friend's wedding in Canandaigua and it was... a hot mess (of fun!)
                        He was completely out of biking shape (I think he actually did not ride his bike at all the 3 months leading up to the trip) but was totally game for 7 straight days of 100 miles each. It didn't quite work out the way we expected, but we learned a lot about each other and, perhaps more importantly, we made it to the wedding!
                        Check out our video for some laughs and some stoke.

            <p>
                The Empire State Trail goes North-to-South and East-to-West across the New York State along the Hudson Valley Greenway, Erie Canalway, and Champlain Valley Trail. The most popular route to take is the <b>Hudson + Erie </b>(about 560 miles), which is what we did plus a little extra back-and-forth.

            <h4>Biking Schedule</h4>
            <p>
                There is certainly no need to bike this quickly. I'd recommend ~60 miles a day, but we chose ~100 miles per day because of the wedding deadline, and also because we are cheap and wanted to do the Hudson Valley portion in the first two days since there was no free camping at the time, and there were 2 warmshowers hosts available 100 miles apart.

There's also a significant on-road portion, but it all feels very safe with few cars. We initially planned to stay with a Warmshowers host in Albany, but they ended up being unavailable. Luckily, this visitor center was nearby! Great facilities, showers for a fee.</td>

Highlights include 1 wipeout, 2 flats, and 1 MILLION snacks at the hotel.

The scenery can feel mundane at times when you're looking at the same canal for hours on end, but I really can't complain when it's all off-road. Also there's a really lovely REI sitting right on the trail near Rochester - great bike tune-up spot!</td>

            <h4>Getting There & Back</h4>
            <p>
                Use <b>Amtrak</b> to complete your trip! The <a class="text-link garage" href="https://www.amtrak.com/empire-service-train" target="_blank">Empire Service</a> and <a class="text-link garage" href="https://www.amtrak.com/maple-leaf-train" target="_blank">Maple Leaf</a> both go between Manhattan (Penn Station) and Buffalo and allow carry-on bicycles. They stop at many points along the route which also provides some peace of mind if you need to bail.
            </p>
            <img class="w-100 rounded margin-top-md" src="../assets/est_mapleleaf.png"/>
            <p>
                This is a popular trail and it seems like most people have heard that biking <b>east</b> (so, not the way we went) on the Erie Canalway is the preferred direction because you're way more likely to have a tailwind the whole way. I kid you not on my way back from Buffalo (when I was biking east), I averaged 17mph whereas I could barely get over 11 on the other days.
            </p>
            <p>
                This does mean that you will want to <b>book your Amtrak tickets as soon as you can if you want to bike east</b> - I met a couple who originally wanted to take the train from Manhattan to Buffalo, and then bike back home, but all the bike tickets were sold out so they had to bike in the other direction.

            <h4>How We Packed the Bike</h4>
            <p>I was super happy with our packing setup - it felt as lean as you can get with panniers! A couple tips:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Store your 'must stay dry' gear separately from anything that you may use during the day.</b> For us, that was our tent, sleeping gear, and clothes. I put my sleeping gear + clothes in 1 waterproof pannier and didn't open that pannier throughout the day. The tent went inside a dry bag. Shep's panniers were not fully waterproof, so his sleeping gear (and sleep clothes) went inside his dry bag.</li>
                    <li><b>Know where your stuff is.</b> The most annoying thing is being wet & cold and then struggling to find the XYZ thing you need. Know where your stuff is! If you're travelling with panniers, consider putting a waterproof sticker one one of them so you can tell them apart haha!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>General Trip Musings</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Camping is a little tricky in the Hudson Valley portion</b> - there aren’t many options if you are looking for sites. I’d recommend looking at Warmshowers options or paying for lodging. On the Erie Canal portion, I highly recommend staying at the lock campsites - they’re wonderfully maintained and the locals are kind.</li>
                    <li><b>Brockport is super bike-friendly</b> and their Welcome Center offers camping, repair station, and showers! The whole town is super cute too.</li>
                    <li><b>On-road portions weave through quiet country roads</b> - there was a brief portion on the side of a faster road somewhere near Ulster but otherwise the on-road parts are extremely chill.</li>
                    <li><b>If it rains, expect some of the Erie Canal portion to get muddy and slow!</b> Shep’s bike had factory 700x28 tires and they performed fine.</li>
                    <li><b>The Erie Canal portion can feel monotonous</b> - it can feel like the same view for HOURS, but I’ll take that over stressing about cars</li>
                    <li><b>There aren’t many biking amenities along the route</b> (specifically, no water refill stations but the occasional porta-potty) but the local towns are close enough to each other that it shouldn’t be a problem.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Parting Thoughts</h4>
            <p>
                I highly, highly recommend this route - it's super beginner-friendly, has signage at every turn, and is mostly off-road. I hope I've provided you with some guidance, and the resources above are wonderful for trip planning. Thanks for reading, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Happy riding!
